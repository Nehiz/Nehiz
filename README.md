## Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm a hands-on Software Developer and Data Science Intern dedicated to creating data-driven solutions in the Educational Technology (EdTech) space.

For nearly a decade, I have focused on building programs that enhance children's learning in areas like Mental Math, Robotics, and Coding. I now leverage my expertise in program design and measurable outcomes with technical skills in Python, Machine Learning, and SQL to create scalable digital tools.

My current work and projects focus on:

EdTech Application Development: Building tools for improved instruction, curriculum deployment, and student engagement (especially in math and STEM).

Data Science & ML in Education: Applying data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical methods to measure and improve learning outcomes.

Backend/Data Engineering: Designing efficient systems for handling educational data and reporting (e.g., student progress, cohort analytics).

I am always looking to collaborate on projects where purpose-driven technology meets human potential.
